# Getting Started

We provide several tutorials for getting started with the scientific filesystem. If you haven't read about the [goals](/scif/goals) or [specification](/scif/spec) for the standard (and are interested) you might do that first.

## Preview and Install
Here we will start with a scientific filesystem recipe, preview what it produces, and then install a scientific filesystem. This is likely the most common use case. [preview and install](/scif/tutorial-preview-install).
